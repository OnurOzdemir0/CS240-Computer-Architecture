### Lab 3 
Lab 3 is an assembler simulator coded in C, that handles instructions according to their types, parameters etc. Similar to the [Venus Similator](https://venus.kvakil.me/). 

### Lab 5
Lab 5 is also similar to Lab 3, (the way it handles instructions etc). However it is coded in Verilog. So it handles memory states (next, current...), which adds another layer of complexity to the assignment.
